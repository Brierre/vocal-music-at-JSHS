        <h3 class="classes" id="#Concert Choir">Concert Choir</h3>
        <p class="classes">
            The concert choir at Jersey Shore is an SATB choir that performs two evening concerts per year. Other performances may include 
            the Star-Spangled Spectacular, a caroling event, and graduation. Concert choir is non-auditioned, although you may be asked to 
            audition to find your voice part, and open to all students in grades 9-12.
        </p>

        <h3 class="classes" id="#Voice 1">Voice 1</h3>
        <p class="classes">
            Voice 1 is for students who want to learn proper vocal technique and how to maintain vocal health. In voice class, we learn 
            the physiology of the vocal apparatus and how to use and maintain it properly. There is a component of Class Voice that is based 
            on in-class performance and many students opt to perform during public performances. It is open to all students in grades 9-12.
        </p>

        <h3 class="classes" id="#Voice 2">Voice 2</h3><span class="badge badge-primary">NEW</span>
        <p class="classes">
            Voice 2 students should have already completed Voice 1. In this class, students will build upon what they learned in Voice 1, 
            focusing more on the performance aspect of things, and learning songs in differing styles. Classical voice training is the basis 
            for most selected pieces, with popular options after classical training has yielded results in breath control, diction, and tone.
        </p>

        <h3 class="classes" id="#Songwriting">Songwriting</h3>
        <p class="classes">
            Songwriting is open to all students. In this course, we study various songwriting techniques and spend time creating songs in a 
            wide variety of ways. Analysis of a typical pop/rock song provides a basic understanding of what is needed to have a successful 
            pop song, and study of basic music theory and harmony allows for the creation of most styles of music. Studying how to write 
            better lyrics is also a component of the class.
        </p>

        <h3 class="classes" id="#American Musical Theatre 1">American Musical Theatre 1</h3>
        <p class="classes">
            In this class, we discuss the history of American Musical Theatre, how Broadway got its start, and notable people on the music 
            scene in the beginning of musical theatre as we know it. Students will create projects based on the historically significant 
            changes in technology and society. Analysis of musicals will also make up a part of this course.
        </p>

        <h3 class="classes" id="#American Musical Theatre 2">American Musical Theatre 2</h3>
        <p class="classes">
            American Musical Theatre 2 will pick up where level 1 left off. Continuing to study musical theatre in this country, we will move 
            into newer eras of the American musical, and we will analyze more shows. There will be a practical component to this course, as it 
            coincides with the production of our high school musical. Real-life problem solving and theatrical design will be some of the things 
            we tackle in AMT2.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="classes" id="#Class Piano">Class Piano</h3><span class="badge badge-primary">NEW</span>
        <p class="classes">
            Class Piano may be taken by any student in grades 9-12. This class is intended to allow students to progress as quickly as they like, 
            with practice time allotted every day and testing of new concepts each week. All students who take this class should be prepared to 
            learn to read music notation and practice for 30 minutes each day. Basic music theory will be taught and applied.
        </p>

        <h3 class="classes" id="#Stage Technology">Stage Technology</h3>
        <p class="classes">
            Stage Technology offers an in-depth look at design and implementation of technical theatre concepts. It includes lighting, sound, and 
            technical design. Students will work with the director of the musical and the set designer to design lighting and sound cues and should 
            be willing to work as part of the crew in the musical production in the spring. Study/analysis of stage performances will comprise a part 
            of the course.
